# drone-time

Decentralised peer-to-peer robot timesharing

Robots have dead time during which they can be rented out to the neighbourhood.

With ETH users can purchase timeshare in a network of drones and utilise a range of services: Area surveillance, Asset tracking, Environmental monitoring, Loud speaker :)

Revenue pathways in the decentralised drone network create a fund for drone-time response to emergency situations
