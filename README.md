# drone-time

Note: very much work in progress. I have never put together a software application before so am learning things as I go along. I am very open to useful suggestions, criticisms, alterations and contributions. I lecture in Physics and Engineering so love IoT. This is a learning exercise for myself to know more about building new technologies and in particular building with Ethereum smart-contracts. As such I would really appreciate the chance to work and learn together. This is intended for people who have similar goals (or of course, those who wish to teach!).

**Decentralised peer-to-peer robot timesharing**

Robots have dead time during which they can be rented out to the neighbourhood.

With ETH users can purchase timeshare in a network of drones and utilise a range of services: Area surveillance, Asset tracking, Environmental monitoring, Loud speaker :)

**rent-a-bot client** ethereum node that shows status of the network and allows purchasing drone time (inc. specialised labour).

**snappy-client** snappy ubuntu client to report drone status to the network and recieve work orders from users/market scouts

**Bonus task**
Revenue pathways in the decentralised drone network create a fund for drone-time response to emergency situations
