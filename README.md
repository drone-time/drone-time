# drone-time

Note: very much work in progress. I have never put together a software application before so am learning things as I go along. I am very open to useful suggestions, criticisms, alterations and contributions. I ecture in Physics and Engineering and have an interest in the Internet and Things so love IoT. This is a learning exercise for myself to know more about building new technologies and as such I would really appreciate the chance to work and learn together.

NoteToo: The interaction with the Etehreum blockchain is important for my learning goals so I will continue with this tool in place.

*Decentralised peer-to-peer robot timesharing*

Robots have dead time during which they can be rented out to the neighbourhood.

With ETH users can purchase timeshare in a network of drones and utilise a range of services: Area surveillance, Asset tracking, Environmental monitoring, Loud speaker :)

Revenue pathways in the decentralised drone network create a fund for drone-time response to emergency situations
