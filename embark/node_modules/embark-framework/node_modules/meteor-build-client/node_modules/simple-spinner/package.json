  "readme": "Supper Simple Spinner for Node.js\n=================================\n\nThis is a supper simple spinner / activity indicator for Node.js.\nI've used it in a few console tools that I've written in Node.js, where I've wanted to show that there is activity and that the program isn't hung.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner/)\n\nHow Simple Is It?\n-----------------\n\nSo simple it only has 3 functions.\n\n * start(\\[interval in ms\\]) \n  * Obviously this starts the spinner. You can give it how quickly you want it to go through the sequence of characters. Defaults to 250ms.\n * stop()\n  * I really shouldn't have to explain this one...\n * change_sequence(sequence)\n  * Use this if you don't like the default spinning stick. Give it an array of strings like this `[\".\", \"o\", \"0\", \"@\", \"*\"]`\n",
